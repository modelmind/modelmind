## Project Setup and Management

This project is managed using a Makefile. The Makefile simplifies the setup and management of various tasks, including installing dependencies, linting, testing, and more.

## Initial Setup

To set up the project for the first time, you need to perform some initial steps:

1. **Install Poetry**: Poetry is used for dependency management. You can install it by following the instructions at [https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation).

2. **Install Google Cloud CLI**: This project uses Google Cloud services (such as Firestore), so you need to install the Google Cloud CLI. Instructions can be found [here](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install#deb).

3. **Install Make**: Make sure `make` is installed on your system. On most Unix-based systems, it should be available by default. For Windows, you can use tools like `choco` or `scoop` to install `make`.

4. **Environment Variables**: Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the necessary environment variables. An example `.env` file:

    ```bash
    JWT__SECRET_KEY="secret"
    FIRESTORE__DATABASE="eu-dev"
    ```

## Using the Makefile

Once the initial setup is complete, you can use the Makefile to manage the project.

### Install Dependencies

To install all necessary dependencies and set up pre-commit hooks, run:

```bash
make install
```

### Pre-commit Hooks

Pre-commit hooks are used to check your code before committing. By default, the following tools are configured:

- **black**: Formats your code.
- **mypy**: Validates types.
- **isort**: Sorts imports in all files.
- **flake8**: Spots possible bugs.

To install the pre-commit hooks, use the `make install` command as mentioned above.

### Linting and Formatting

To lint and format your code, run:

```bash
make lint
make format
```

### Running Tests

To run tests and generate a coverage report, use:

```bash
make test
```

### Watching for Changes

To run tests automatically on every change, run:

```bash
make watch
```

### Updating Dependencies

To update poetry dependencies and export them to `requirements.txt`, run:

```bash
make poetry-update
```

Simple export without updating dependencies:
```bash
make poetry-export
```

## Infrastructure

This project uses Terraform for managing infrastructure as code on Google Cloud. We also use a Cloud Build trigger (`deploy_cloud_run_prod.yml`) for CI/CD to deploy our application to Google Cloud Run.
